		<p>Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce</p>
<p>Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms</p>
<p>The maids come around too much</p>
<p>Parents ain't around enough</p>
<p>Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar</p>
<p>Too many white lies and white lines</p>
<p>Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends</p>

<br>
<p>Start my day up on the roof</p>
<p>There's nothing like this type of view</p>
<p>Point the clicker at the tube</p>
<p>I prefer expensive news</p>
<p>New car, new girl</p>
<p>New ice, new glass</p>
<p>New watch, good times babe</p>
<p>It's good times, yeah</p>
<p>She wash my back three times a day</p>
<p>This shower head feels so amazing</p>
<p>We'll both be high, the help don't stare</p>
<p>They just walk by, they must don't care</p>
<p>A million one, a million two</p>
<p>A hundred more will never do </p></br>

<br>
<p>Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce</p>
<p>Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms</p>
<p>The maids come around too much</p>
<p>Parents ain't around enough</p>
<p>Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar</p>
<p>Too many white lies and white lines</p>
<p>Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends</p>
<p>Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends</p>
</br>

<br>
<p>Real love, I'm searching for a real love</p>
<p>Oh, real love, I'm searching for a real love</p>
<p>Oh, real love</p>

		<p>Close your eyes to what you can't imagine</p>
<p>We are the Xanny-gnashing</p>
<p>Caddy-smashing, bratty ass</p>
<p>He mad, he snatched his daddy's Jag</p>
<p>And used the shit for batting practice</p>
<p>Adamant and he thrashing</p>
<p>Purchasing crappy grams with half the hand of cash you handed</p>
<p>Panic and patch me up</p>
<p>Pappy done latch-keyed us</p>
<p>Toying with Raggy Anns and Mammy done had enough</p>
<p>Brash as fuck, breaching all these aqueducts</p>
<p>Don't believe us</p>
<p>Treat us like we can't erupt, yup</p>

		<h3>[Frank Ocean]</h3>
		<p>Polo sweats and Hermes blankets</p>
<p>Them label hoes be stealing my shit</p>
<p>And all they clothes revealing they tits</p>
<p>Pills, high enough to touch the rim in that bitch</p>
<p>We party in my living room</p>
<p>Cause father is gone</p>
<p>And he left me this empire</p>
<p>That runs on its own</p>
<p>So all I got to do is whatever the fuck I want</p>
<p>All we ever do is whatever the fuck we want</p>

<br><p>
	We end our day up on the roof</p>
<p>I say I'll jump, I never do</p>
<p>But when I'm drunk I act a fool</p>
<p>Talking bout, do they sew wings on tailored suits</p>
<p>I'm on that ledge, she grabs my arm</p>
<p>She slaps my head</p>
<p>It's good times, yeah</p>
<p>Sleeve rips off, I slip, I fall</p>
<p>The market's down like 60 stories</p>
<p>And some don't end the way they should</p>
<p>My silver spoon has fed me good</p>
<p>A million one, a million cash</p>
<p>Close my eyes and feel the crash
</p></br>

<br>
<p>Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce</p>
<p>Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms</p>
<p>The maids come around too much</p>
<p>Parents ain't around enough</p>
<p>Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar</p>
<p>Too many white lies and white lines</p>
<p>Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends</p>
<p>Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends</p></br>

<br><p>Real love, ain't that something rare</p>
<p>I'm searching for a real love, talking bout real love</p>
<p>Real love yeah</p>
<p>Real love</p>
<p>I'm searching for a real love</p>
<p>Talking bout a real love</p></br>
