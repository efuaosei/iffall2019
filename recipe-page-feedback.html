	<h2>Notes on Imprvement</h2>
	<p>I plan to fix all the small font size and color things. I will then fix the spacing concerns, specifically with the margin and padding of things such that they have adequate room and are aligned with each other. I will consider chnaging the Handwritten Font, but will see if changing size or color first will fix the legibility problem. I also may chnage the header pictire so that it looks like the actual final product, and not a random picture of French Toast.</p>
