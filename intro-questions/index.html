			<li> Name: Efua Major: African & African American Studies Minor: Political Science and Design Year: 2021 </li>
			<li> I started Freshmen and Sophomore Year of High School in Architecture Classes (mostly CAD). And then I changed to socia studies and have been in the humanities and social sciences sicne, but I really missed the hands on, creatuve thinking based classes having to do with design. This led to me to want to pursue a minor in Design, and this class interested me in the web design aspect of design. </li>
			<li>I do not have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS or coding. I used to have a Tumblr blog that required an html code that i wuld often open source! </li>
			<li>I hope to be able to use these skills to build my own portfolio-esque website for future employers.</li>
			<li>Designing for screen seems to be much more tedious and time consuming than desiging on paper. </li>

			I like to read the Huffington Post's Black Voices Column often, and this interative module that was created was one of my favorite projects I read from them. It was aesthtically nice, easy to use, and richly informative. It achieved a goal of mine to educate the masses by means of artistic and creative designed modes of communication. I believe this exemplifies beautiful web design.</li>
			<li> https://www.wikipedia.org/ 
			Most Wikipedia pages are great examples of  effective communication, and gets the message across to the viewr/reader. Navigating the website is easily understandable and the information is readily availale for consumption. </li>
			<li>https://twitter.com/ 
			I think social networking sites are good examples of websites that work well, and twitter consistently is changing their interface and applications to make the using of twitter easier for its consumers. </li>
